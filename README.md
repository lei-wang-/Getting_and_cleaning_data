This is the readme file
This directory includes three files besides this one.

The major part is the R script run_analysis.R
It merges the trainging data and test data to one data set,
Only features relevant to the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
are selected. Descriptive activity names are applied to name the activities in dataset.
The features of dataset are labelled appropriately using descriptive activity names.
Finally, a tidy data set is created with the mean values of features for each subjective and activity pair.

The CodeBook.md file elaborate the process of obtaining the tidy data.
